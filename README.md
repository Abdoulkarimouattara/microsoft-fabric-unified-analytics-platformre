# 🚀 Microsoft Fabric Medallion Architecture (Online Retail Analytics)

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an **end-to-end analytics platform using Microsoft Fabric**.

The solution follows the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)** to transform raw e-commerce data into trusted, business-ready datasets for reporting and decision-making.

The project showcases several core Microsoft Fabric capabilities:

- OneLake
- Lakehouse
- Dataflow Gen2
- Notebooks (PySpark)
- Semantic Models
- Power BI

## 🏗️ Architecture & Pipeline Workflow

### 1️⃣ Bronze Layer – Data Ingestion

The Online Retail dataset is manually uploaded into the Fabric Lakehouse and loaded into the Bronze layer without modification.

**Objectives:**
- Preserve source data
- Ensure traceability
- Support future reprocessing

**Source:**
- Kaggle Online Retail Dataset

### 2️⃣ Silver Layer – Data Transformation

Dataflow Gen2 is used to clean, standardize, and enrich the raw data.

**Transformations include:**
- Missing value handling
- Data type corrections
- Duplicate removal
- Column standardization
- Revenue calculations
- Business enrichment

**New features created:**
- `line_total`
- `year`
- `month`
- `is_return`

### 3️⃣ Gold Layer – Business Processing

Fabric Notebooks (PySpark) are used to generate business-ready analytical datasets.

**Business Analytics:**

#### Revenue Analytics
- Total Revenue
- Revenue by Month
- Revenue by Country
- Revenue Growth Trends

#### Order Analytics
- Total Orders
- Average Order Value
- Order Volume Trends

#### Product Analytics
- Top Products by Revenue
- Top Products by Quantity Sold

#### Customer Analytics
- Top Customers by Spending
- Customer Lifetime Value
- RFM Segmentation
